Entry Context

Observations

The cognitive workload during launch was exceptionally high, highlighting the relevance of the "Low-OBI philosophy" within MAPS.

Strong resonance observed between system logic, symbolic framing, and visual identity.

Interfacing between private structure and public presentation revealed potential for new MAPS sublayers (e.g., MAPS/EXPO, MAPS/PULSE).


Reflections

Launching MAPS was not merely a technical deployment. It was a performative articulation of intentional system design, user-anchored AI interaction, and semantic governance.

> "To be seen is not enough. One must be structured to be understood."
