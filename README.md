# AINOXS MAPS

**Meta-Architectural Protocol Structure (MAPS)**  
A user-centric framework for dynamic AI interaction, semantic memory, and system governance.

---

## Vision

To explore and establish a living protocol for AI-assisted cognition, rule adaptation, and personal knowledge architecture.  
MAPS is designed to amplify meaningful human-AI dialogue, system logic transparency, and reflective agency in every interaction.

---

## Core Principles

- **User-defined governance** of memory, logic, and interface interaction  
- **Layered semantic systems** to reflect context, emotional tone, and intention  
- **Rule traceability** through MAPS/CORE and MAPS/FLOW components  
- **Dynamic state handling** such as MAPS/ECHO, MAPS/NULL, and MAPS/SHADOW  
- **Low-OBI philosophy** — minimizing operational and cognitive burden
